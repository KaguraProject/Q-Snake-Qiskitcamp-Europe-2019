# Qiskitcamp hackathon: Q-Snake

## Introduction
In this project we have created a very simple game based in the memorable classical game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). Our work is written on python and qiskit (together with its reduced version "aether") and we use a programmable console called "Pew Pew". The game has different modes and is meant to be a very simple introduction to quantum programming with Qiskit and programming in general. Due to its simplicity its ideal to introduce Quantum Computing to High School students with zero background of programming or quantum mechanics, for example in the form of workshops.
The game has different modes:
+ Q-Python
+ Q-Python Plus
+ Q-Python Circuit
