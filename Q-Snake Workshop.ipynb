    "In this game, the player controls a moving snake that moves around a 8x8 grid. The first thing we need to create is a moving dot that will represent the head of the snake. We will set up the controls. The snake cannot stop moving so our only actions are changing the direction of movement of the snake. For that we will use the keys  ▲, ▼, ◄ and ►. Rememeber that the snake cannot move backwards so in each step of the game the player has only two possible options."
