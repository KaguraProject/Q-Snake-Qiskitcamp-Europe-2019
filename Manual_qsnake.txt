MANUAL

###########
PewPew Mode
###########
(files:
gamesfile: main.py
requirements: put aether.py into the documents of the PewPew)

Rules:
Turn PewPew on (left side down, small switch)
use the four buttons on the left upper side to stear snake
eat apples to grow larger
GAME OVER conditions:
  - biting the snakes tail
  - hitting the side borders
  - snake doens't tunnel through internal barrier (probability 50%)
try tunneling through internal barrier with 50% probability

########################
Tunneling (Desktop) Mode
########################
(files:
gamefile: qsdtunnel_multi.py
requirements: put pew.py into same directory as the gamefile
              install pygame library)

Rules:
Start the game using console (Terminal)
classical snake game rules with the following additions:
The length of the snake represents its energy. A higher energy corresponds to
a higher tunneling probability. The snake is able to tunnel through the side
barriers with this specific probability. If the head does not tunnel this means
game over. If any consecutive segment doesn not tunnel its deleted from the snake
tail. The probability for any tail segment top tunnel is smaller than the one for the
head. It is adviced not to try tunneling when having fewer than 4 segments. If the snake
consists only of its head it can always tunnel.


#######################
Circuit (Desktop) Mode
#######################
(files:
gamefiles: Level1: circuit_snake.py
           Level2: Qsnake_circuit.py
requirements: Level1: pew1.py
              Level2: pew_circuit.py, 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, 4.png, background.jpeg, gateback.jpeg)


Rules:
Level1:
The goal is to transform the |0> state into the |1> by using only H, Z and Measuring(M). You Start
in the |0> state by default. You can apply gates by letting the snake eat the RED dots. Make sure
you eat the right gate, otherwise you lose (correct order: H, Z, H, M). You switch the current gate
by pressing the 'Z' key on your keyboard.
Level2:
The goal is to transform the |0> state into the |1> by using only H, Z and Measuring(M). You Start
in the |0> state by default. You can apply gates by letting the snake eat the RED dots. Make sure
you eat the right gate, otherwise you lose (correct order: H, Z, H, M). You switch the current gate
by pressing the 'Z' key on your keyboard. Everytime when eating
a gate a GREEN dot will appear. The GREEN dots represent quantum errors that increase with increasing
computation time (= the time you need to construct the circuit). DON'T eat the GREEN dots or it's game over.
There is no tunneling feature in this mode and even though the barriers are not shown they exist outside
the display (8x8 pixels to play). Hitting the borders is a game over condition.
The current circuit will be displayed on the lower right of the display.
